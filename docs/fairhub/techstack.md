## Backend

The backend is the server-side of the application. It is responsible for handling requests from the frontend and communicating with the database. Currently communication is done via [REST](https://api.fairhub.io).

## Testing

Testing is an important part of the development process. It helps to ensure that the code is working as intended and that it is not breaking existing functionality. It also helps to ensure that the code is maintainable and that it is easy to extend. Testing is done in two ways: unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing is done on the frontend and backend. Integration testing is done on the backend. The frontend is tested by simulating user interactions and checking the results. The backend is tested by sending requests to the API and checking the results.

## Dependency management

The frontend and backend are both written in different languages. This means that they have different dependency management systems. The frontend uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and the backend uses [Anaconda](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Both systems are used to install and manage dependencies.
